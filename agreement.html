<p class="style1">Data stored on The University of New Mexico (UNM) computers are an institutional resource belonging to the University. These data are available to qualified individuals for University-related uses. The user agrees to make responsible and ethical use of the data in cooperation with the offices that manage and maintain the data, the offices with functional or custodial responsibility.</p>

<p class="style1"><b>The user should understand that some data are confidential, and may be sensitive. </b>The indiscriminate use or release of such data could bring harm to the university, an individual student, or interfere with the function of a UNM organization.</p>

<p class="style1">The user should avoid, if possible, making data requests to multiple offices to minimize the duplication of effort accross offices. Problems are unlikely to materialize in an atmosphere of courtesy, cooperation and dialogue between the requesting user and the office with functional or custodial responsibility.</p> 

<p class="style1">A qualified user will adhere to the following conditions. Failure to meet these conditions can result in the loss of access to University data.

<ol>

<li><p class="style1">The user understands that no sensitive data, including address lists or mailing labels, should be released or redisclosed to other parties without agreement from the EMRT. Such agreement should be explicitly obtained when reports or publications derived from analysis of the data are to be released. Furthermore, confidential (Unit-Record) data will never be released to third parties. In no case should data be released specific to any student for whom a privacy flag is set (in accordance with FERFA).</li></p>
